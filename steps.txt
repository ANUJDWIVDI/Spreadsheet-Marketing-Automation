📋 Step-by-step instructions for setting up your Spreadsheet Marketing Automation script 🚀

Create a new Google Sheets spreadsheet 📝

> Go to Google Drive and click "New" -> "Google Sheets".
 Give your spreadsheet a name and add columns for the email addresses you want to target in your marketing campaign.
 Note the ID of your spreadsheet, which can be found in the URL (e.g. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit).
 Create a new Google Apps Script project 💻

> Open the Script Editor in your Google Sheets spreadsheet by clicking "Tools" -> "Script editor".
 Create a new Apps Script project by clicking "File" -> "New project".
 Give your project a name and paste the code from the src/main.gs file in this repository into the Script Editor.
 Update the script with your spreadsheet ID and marketing message 📨

> Replace the SPREADSHEET_ID placeholder in the script with the actual ID of your spreadsheet.
 Replace the MESSAGE placeholder in the script with your own marketing message.
 Save and run the script 🚀

> Click "File" -> "Save" to save your changes to the script.
 Click the "play" button in the toolbar to run the script.
 Grant permission for the script to send emails on your behalf if prompted.
 Check your email to confirm that the script successfully sent your marketing message to the targeted email addresses.
 Automate your marketing campaign with a time-driven trigger ⏰

> Click "Edit" -> "Current project's triggers" in the Script Editor.
 Click the "Add Trigger" button to create a new trigger.
 Choose a time-driven trigger that fits your marketing campaign schedule (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly).
 Save the trigger and verify that it's enabled.
 
 That's it! Your Spreadsheet Marketing Automation script is now set up and ready to help you reach your target audience with ease. 🎉
